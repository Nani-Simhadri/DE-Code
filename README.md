## Introduction to Differential Evolution (DE) Algorithm
The DE algorithm is a population-based heuristic algorithm [1] used to optimize non-linear and non-differentiable continuous space functions. 
The DE algorithm uses three processes known as mutation, crossover, and selection to optimize the functions.

The DE algorithm has been employed for the optimization of some of the electronics and instrumentation systems, and a list of the research papers, 
which have discussed the applications of the DE algorithm towards the instrumentation area, is given below.
